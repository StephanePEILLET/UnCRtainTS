    """
    Function taken from https://github.com/prs-eth/U-TILISE/blob/main/lib/datasets/dataset_tools.py

    Extracts the position index for every observation in an image time series, expressed as the number of days since
    a given reference date. The position indices will be used for sinusoidal positional encoding in the temporal encoder
    of U-TILISE.

    Args:
        dates:     list of datetime.date dates, acquisition dates for every observation in the sequence.
        strategy:  str, specifies the reference date. Choose among:
                        'day-of-year':          The position of each observation is expressed as the number of days
                                                since the 1st of January of the respective year, where the
                                                1st of January equals position 0 (i.e, seasonal information is
                                                implicitly encoded in the position).
                        'day-within-sequence':  The position of each observation is expressed relative to the first
                                                observation in the sequence, i.e., the first observation in the sequence
                                                is encoded as position 0 (i.e, seasonal information is not encoded in
                                                the position).
                        'absolute':             The position of each observation is expressed as the number of days
                                                since the reference date `REFERENCE_DATE`.
                        'enumeration':          Simple enumeration of the observations, i.e., 0, 1, 2, 3, etc.

    Returns:
        position:  torch.Tensor, number of days since a given reference date for every observation in the sequence.
